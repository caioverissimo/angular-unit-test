# angular-unit-test

Basic try to developing unit tests for AngularJS FrontEnd

# examples structure
Inside app/components we have the different scripts, that presents the various examples initially implemented, accordion the references pointed on README.txt.
As I create new examples, their names will be listed here. Here I go:

* example1 ["AngularJS: Up And Running" (book)]
* example2 [Sitepoint — "Unit and End to End Testing in AngularJS"]




## My Comments

The idea is try to implement the first tip from 'AngularJS: Up And Running' for an AngularJS Front-End unit tests
